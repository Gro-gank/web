<h3>Legal Use</h3>
<p>
The CTFA Training Program is designed to provide young students with an introduction to Cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity career field is a fast-growing field and a greater number of professionals will be needed to combat future cyber threats. To accomplish this goal, it is necessary to introduce the student to various skills that, if used inappropriately, can result in violation of laws. The sole purpose for the training is to generate interest in protecting from cyber threats, not becoming one. 
</p>

<p>
CTFA personnel cannot be responsible for the inappropriate or illegal actions of any students that learn techniques from this training program that elect to use these skills to commit crimes or otherwise harm persons or organizations. Great care is made to ensure students understand the impact of using the skills learned in an improper manner; however, CTFA cannot be liable for the actions of these individuals as CTFA does not condone illegal actions of any kind.
